This is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet">Bookmarklet</a> to help you spy on Shopify stores, and see what new products they are adding to their stores

In this Bookmarklet we're using Feedly site to spy on shopify Stores using RSS, you can spy on shopify Stores without this Bookmarklet, by copying the URL of the shopify store and go to Feedly site and enter the URL of the store + /collections/all.atom at the end of the URL.

But by using this Bookmarklet you'll be more productive

You don't have to copy the URL and go to Feedly site every time

just one simple click will open a new browser tab and search for the shopify RSS and you just need to click on follow to follow the store.
